# DINE AND DONATE - D&D

We have established our project idea ‚ÄúDINE AND DONATE‚Äù into a mobile app by taking into account all the necessary requirements, scheduling , system models and references. Also , to carry out
the demonstration using APIS like google cloud api , yelp api , redux framework is used and is built with the help of REACT JS.

The main aim of the project is to develop a online food ordering app that has an admin who maintains and modifies the food items and manages the activities related to the application
and the users who can login/signup and view the food items available , search for their favourite food items and also add items to cart proceeding with their orders and payments .
Also , when the user feels like cancelling the order he/she can go for donation under NGO registration and gets a refund of 50% for the same. Additionally , the user can also get the
suggestions i.e, the type of food that is suitable to have based on the user‚Äôs location , time and
weather. The system is built as five different modules as follows ,


‚ùñ SEARCH MODULE üîé

‚ùñ DISPLAY MODULE üñ•Ô∏è

‚ùñ DONATE AND REFUND MODULE üíù

‚ùñ RECOMMENDATION MODULE üåç
